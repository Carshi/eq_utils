## eq_utils
This is a collection of small python scripts that pull info out of an EverQuest character's log.

## Stuff In Here
`deaths`: Outputs a list of the enemies that have killed the provided character.

`faction_check`: Outputs the numbers of positive and negative faction hits the provided character has received for the given faction. Obviously this isn't perfect, but it's the only information we can actually get about standing.

`levels`: Outputs the time to level. Again, not perfect - there's no way to track played time. I also don't have it written to track time played at level 1, but also, who cares about time played at level 1.
